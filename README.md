## 🧑🏻‍🏫 Coding Journey

My coding journey started in a rather unexpected place – the world of behavioral research in psychology. As a wide-eyed bachelor's student in psychology, I stumbled upon the power of coding when I decided to use R for statistical analysis in my research projects. Little did I know that this seemingly pragmatic choice would set me on a fascinating path towards a completely different career. The more I delved into coding, the more enamored I became with its logic and creativity. This passion prompted a career switch, and now, as a computer science student, I aspire to be a full-stack developer. The transition was challenging, but with each coding project, I honed my skills and solidified my commitment to mastering the technologies that make up this vast field. From psychology to computer science, my journey has been transformative, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that coding brings to my future as a full-stack developer.
